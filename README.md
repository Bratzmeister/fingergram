# Fingergram 

## What is this for?
Search users in groups (and in which groups is the user) by id, username or phone number (if it's in your contacts).

## What do I need?
To use this tool you need [Telegram API](https://my.telegram.org/) creds. After you registered a new app, edit `api_creds.ini` file accordingly.

## Usage

clone this repo
`git clone insert nigger here && cd fingergram`

create venv
`python -m venv .`

activate venv
`source bin/activate`

...
`python fingergram.py`

## Limitations
To know if a user is in a group, you have to be in that group too. You can't know which users are in a specific channel if you are not an administrator.
